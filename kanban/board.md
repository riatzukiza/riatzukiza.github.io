- [ ] [Update physics engine to increase accuracy and performance](tasks/Update%20physics%20engine%20to%20increase%20accuracy%20and%20performance.md)
	  - Consolodate position and velocity into physics
	  - When performing updates, do not mutate the state of the
	last tick. Use two data structures, and swap them out [each](../docs/Pools/Dynamic/each.md) tick.
- [ ] [unit system](tasks/unit%20system.md)
	  - A unit is an abstraction over an entity.
	  - Entities can be anything in the game
	  - A unit is a dynamic collection of entities
	- Like say a weapon, a shield
- [ ] [deletable entites](tasks/deletable%20entites.md)
	  - Entities can be deleted from a panel

- [ ] [a gpu implementation for signal fields and vector math.](tasks/a%20gpu%20implementation%20for%20signal%20fields%20and%20vector%20math..md)
	  - Use tensorflow.js
- [ ] [SPIKE can we simplify object pools (2 hrs)](tasks/SPIKE%20can%20we%20simplify%20object%20pools%20(2%20hrs).md)
- [ ] [simulation backend](tasks/simulation%20backend.md)
	  - Realizing after adding a toggle for the trail dots that rendering was not what was slowing the sim down
	We have decided to move this out of the todo backlog, as it will not be as much of a value add as we'd 
	have liked. The simulation needs more [Optimizations](tasks/Optimizations.md), and we don't currently have a place to host such an intensive backend.


## Todo (5)

- [ ] [move kit fs](tasks/move%20kit%20fs.md)
- [ ] [chat app MVP](tasks/chat%20app%20MVP.md)
- [ ] [github readme](tasks/github%20readme.md)
	  - The [readme](../readme.md) can be generated from this kanban through simple concatonation.
- [ ] [Add beautifier and beautifier to pipeline to pipeline](tasks/Add%20beautifier%20and%20beautifier%20to%20pipeline%20to%20pipeline.md)
	  - Maybe this should be [done](done.md) at the same time as hot reloading? it is at least [blocked](blocked.md) by that task.


## In Progress (2)

- [ ] [Brain storm new projects](tasks/Brain%20storm%20new%20projects.md)
