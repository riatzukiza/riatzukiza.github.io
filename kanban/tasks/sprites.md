# Sprites

Make the game look better with some sprite [Graphics](Graphics.md), we have an existing sprite implementation. It may be worth investigating different [Graphics](Graphics.md) engines at this point?
I'm not sure if individually placing dots is the best way to be doing sprites. It should
work for now. We know we have cod e for 3d stuff in another repository.


## Requirements

- Create [Sprite sheets](Sprite%20sheets.md) for agents and rocks
- Try existing sprite system, compare speed to vertex rendering mode speed.
- If speed is unreasonable, create a [New Task](../templates/New%20Task.md) to look into other [Graphics](Graphics.md) 
  engine solutions, or write a new shader for sprites.
