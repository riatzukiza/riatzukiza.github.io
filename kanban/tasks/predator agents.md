# Predator agents

Like in the original symbiants using a scalar signal field, I want to introduce predation. I'd like it to be a little more nuanced then the way I did it before, just spawnings new factions and weighted randomly selecting a food source based on total number of agents belonging to [each](../docs/Pools/Dynamic/each.md) type of food. This may require a little more thought. I can get a basic system up now. Maybe all agents can choose to be a predator based on how recently they've found food?

## Blocked by

- attack sytem
- [multiple factions](multiple%20factions.md)

## requirements

- A system for ants to win when they kill another ant
- Path finding allows predator agents to consistently find other ants.
