Are there obsidian plugins that could create git [project](../project.md) boards from the obsidian kanban?

[Using the API to manage Projects - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/using-the-api-to-manage-projects)
[Forming calls with GraphQL - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#about-mutations)

This seems possible

## Requirements

- Changes to the [board](../board.md) get reflected to a github [project](../project.md) [board](../board.md) on push to a specific branch
- Changes to the [project](../project.md) [board](../board.md) on github get reflected onto the obsidian [board](../board.md) and pushed to a specific branch
- All changes get a pull request
