I'm thinking monkai. If we make the website from obsidian using the export functionality, we can make our lives easier.

# Requirements
- A styled html page for our frontpage
- an explaination of decisions made
- user stories like "As a potential client visiting my portfolio I..."


## Review

I have some [Colors](../../Colors.md) I want to use, mainly from the monokai theme. I will continue to look for more of the [Colors](../../Colors.md), for example from obsidians monokai, but for now it's working.

How do emacs themes work? Where would there color data be stored?
