# Reverse navigation home

Agents need to be able to find their way home. This will be [done](../done.md) by adding a new field, and/or reversing the ants relationship to the existing fields. 
They follow them in the reverse.

## Requirements

- Agents consistently make it to goals and back.
- A new agent is spawned only by returning back to the objective

## Blocked by

- Trail entities
- [multiple signal fields](multiple%20signal%20fields.md)?
