Agents need to slowly use resources they have consumed to survive.
Agent should starve to death to loose unless killed by another agent.

## Requirements

- Units consume plant matter to survive
- Units mass is based on how much food it has consumed.
- There is a maximum amount of food the agent can contain inside of them
- Once an agent is full they begin going home.
- Agents will not eat food they are carrying unless they get "hungry"

- Agents are spawned hungry
