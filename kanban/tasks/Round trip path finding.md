## Description

Agents need to find a path back home. With our new A* path finding system, they will inverse the vector they layed to get home, and combine them with another field specifically for finding the way home, to assist in avoiding collisions with ants on their way to the goal.
## Requirements

- Agents consistently make it to goals and back.
- A new agent is spawned only by returning back to the objective
- Ants use A* to find paths and explore like in crash landed
- A new field for satiated ants returning home with food
- A new field for satiated ants looking for food to bring home
- If a collision is detected during traversal of the path traced by A*, A new path will be generated
- Experiment with a collisions vector field
- Everything is reusable in crash landed.
## Tasks 

- [ ] Update ants to use A* path finding
- [ ] Add fog of war to ants
- [ ] Add exploration behavior from crash landed to symbiants/obstacles
## Blocked by

- [Layered Vector Field System](Layered%20Vector%20Field%20System.md)?
