# Description

Since we use webgl to render our content, the logic for pooling these components is [done](../done.md) at a lower level. The object pool current creates a buffer that can fit 100,000 instances of the given data type.
## Requirements

- [ ] [Graphics](Graphics.md) systems don't break the game when large numbers of members are generated
- [ ] the pool does not dramaticly effect performance

## Tasks 

- [ ] Implement dynamic pools around typed buffers
- [ ] Test pools performance using browser benchmarking tools.
