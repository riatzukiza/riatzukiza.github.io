Title: Implement Ranged Attack System

Description: This document outlines the implementation of a ranged attack system for our game. The system will allow players to attack targets from a distance using projectiles such as arrows, bullets, or spells. It will include mechanics such as accuracy, range, and damage calculation based on factors like weapon type, distance, and target armor.
