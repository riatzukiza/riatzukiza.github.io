## Requirements

- [ ] everything in the code base continues to function 
- [ ] Code has been moved from kit-js/repl

## Tasks

- [ ] Move library into shared and inc
- [ ] core library is a part of compiler so code does not need includes.
- [ ] [Remove duplicate code included in headers.](Remove%20duplicate%20code%20included%20in%20headers..md) while you are at ‚è´
- [ ] [Cull duplicate macros](Cull%20duplicate%20macros.md) Put a dent in this, some of the dups are probably from other libraries too.
