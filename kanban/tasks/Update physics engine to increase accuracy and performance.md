Using symbiants and algae programs as reference, implement physics system in a way that does not alter the previous game state while generating the current one.

## Requirements

- physics simulations are more accurate
- Collision detection does not depend on the order physics systems are updated.
## Tasks 

{{Tasks}}

  - Consolodate position and velocity into physics
  - When performing updates, do not mutate the state of the
last tick. Use two data structures, and swap them out [each](../docs/Pools/Dynamic/each.md) tick.
