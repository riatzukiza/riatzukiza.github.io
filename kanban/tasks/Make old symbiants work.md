I've made symbiants work by its self before, it should not be hard to get it working here on this website. If I have more projects I will have more incentive to write the [Home page](Home%20page.md) and [project](../project.md) pages. Right now there isn't a lot else than the vector ants, so those pages would be pretty empty.

## Requirements
- Old cellular automata ACO algorithim works in new framework the same way it did in it's own repo.
- There is a link pointing to it on the [project](../project.md) page

## Tasks

- [ ] Move code into src/client
- [ ] update `require`s to use new namespacing system
- [ ] integrate updates to game systems from @shared that were previously in sibilant-game-engine
- [ ] Move any utilities from symbiants into @shared


## Epics
