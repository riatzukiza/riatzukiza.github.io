# Description

Add a config/settings panel toggle for coordinate systems wrap around. The entities should bounce off the edge of the map like they do off other collisions.
## Related Epics
- [Game Mechanics](Game%20Mechanics.md)
## Requirements

- Wrap around can be toggled off by config file
- Wrap around can be toggled off in the settings panel
- Entities trigger an elastic collision (simple collision) when they encounter the edge when wrap around is toggled off.
- The toggle can be [done](../done.md) without resetting the simulation
