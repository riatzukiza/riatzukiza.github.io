# Resource Mechanics

Resources other than plants exist. The entites can do things with the resources. Entities take the resources home. Entities require resources to be spawned. 
This issue will not add other resources, but follow on work that adds new resources will depend on this one. The only resource we will add is plant matter.

## Requirements

- Agents can carry objects
- The faction requires resources to create new agents
- agents require resources to be created.
- Factions have a resource counter interface

## Blocked by

- [x] trail entities ✅ 2025-01-12
  - resource mechanics will require agents lives to
  be dictated by somthing other than a max trail length if they can only be created with resources being added
- [x] [Round trip path finding](Round%20trip%20path%20finding.md) ✅ 2025-01-12
  - Agents have to be able to make it home in order to find and return resources.
  - We have this through A*, though the precise behavior is to be implemented on a need by need basis
