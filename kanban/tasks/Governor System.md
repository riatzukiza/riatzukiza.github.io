# Description

An AI governeror you can communicate with that will act in your place setting priorities, issueing orders, and setting agendas automaticly. When the governor is unsure of how to react to a situation it will alert you. You will be able to interact with the governors at any time.
Governors can also work against you if you give them reasons to. They can do everything that you can do, including communicating with, creating, and dismissing other governors.

There will be different types of governors
- Generals
- commanders
- politicians
- logicians
- Probably more

Additionally, you can define your own governors by customizing permissions, and decision hierarchies, all of which are also tasks that you can assign a governor to do.
