## Description

Since the browser has added import statements, there is really very little use in
bundling/browserifying code that I have written. 
We do however still need access to external dependencies. 
We need to change the bundling pipeline to just create a single 
bundle that contains all of the npm node_modules external dependencies. 
The one that pops to mind immediately is our quadtree lib. 
This should be done first, so it will require adjustments to 
the current pipeline to exclude these modules from the existing bundles. 
If we were to for some reason continue to want to browserify our system, these modules are being duplicated unnecessarily in each bundle. 
It would save time during bundling to exclude them.

## Requirements

- A single bundle is generated by the pipeline for external dependencies.
- Existing code that depends on external modules work as before.
- existing bundles do not include duplicates of external dependencies.
## Tasks 

- [ ] Implement external require bundling logic.
- [ ] Exclude external dependencies from current bundler logic.
- [ ] modify template file to include the new bundle
- [ ] validate all projects continue to work with new bundling logic.
