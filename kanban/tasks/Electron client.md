I had a pretty nice system for running lisp in electron I can move into this [project](../project.md). Something I want to do is to have a distrobutable binary of [each](../../docs/Pools/Dynamic/each.md) of the portfolio projects in the github releases

## Requirements
- Entire application works from electron shell

## Tasks
- [ ] Find a working implementation of the electron sibilant shell from old projects
- [ ] Use what you can from it to run the program in electron
- [ ] add link to hosted website to download electron clients for [each](../../docs/Pools/Dynamic/each.md) of the [project](../project.md) samples.
