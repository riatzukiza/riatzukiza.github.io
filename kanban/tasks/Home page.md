# Home page

Any good website, especially the portfolio of a developer, needs a good home page.
it should have a nav panel, a brief synopsis of what it is I do and how I do it
it should have references to my work, somthing resembling my resume.

Basicly everything on my resume must be in some way present on this website.

## Requirements

- Has a navagation menu
- Explains what I am about
- Has links to my github, linkedin, twitter, blue sky, etc
- Has links to the projects I have worked on

## Review

I have a color pallette I am working from, and a basic layout of the home page. I started working on the [project](../project.md) page next. I need to have stuff to show off  on the website to use it.
