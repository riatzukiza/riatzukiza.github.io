## Description

To create a Real-Time strategy game that meets the pairity with existing Time strategy games, we will focus on implementing key features from various epics. This includes:

### Related Epics

*   **Game Mechanics**: Implementing mechanics such as resource gathering, unit production, and building construction.
*   **Game AI**: Developing artificial intelligence for units to make decisions during gameplay.
*   **Intelligent movement commands**: Creating algorithms that allow units to move efficiently and effectively.

## Requirements

### Key Features

*   **Movement Waypoints**: Implementing a system where players can set waypoints for their units to follow, allowing for more strategic movement planning.
*   **Building System**: Developing a building system that allows players to construct structures such as barracks, factories, and research facilities.
*   **Unit System**: Creating an unit system with different types of units, each with unique abilities and strengths.
*   **Attack System**: Implementing an attack system where units can engage in combat with other units or structures.
*   **Multiple Factions**: Supporting multiple factions with their own units, buildings, and strategies.
*   **Resource Mechanics**: Introducing resource gathering mechanics to manage resources such as gold, food, and materials.
*   **Minimap**: Creating a minimap that displays important information about the game world, including unit locations and resource availability.
*   **Fog of War**: Implementing a fog of war system that reduces visibility in certain areas of the map.
*   **Line of Sight System**: Developing a line of sight system that allows players to see the position of their units relative to each other.
*   **Sprite Sheets**: Using sprite sheets to display unit and building graphics.
*   **Order Queues**: Implementing an order queue system that allows players to plan and execute complex strategies.
*   **Ground Tiles**: Creating ground tiles with different properties such as terrain, obstacles, and resource availability.
*   **Predator Agents**: Supporting predator agents that can be used to hunt down enemy units or structures.
*   **Reverse Navigation Home**: Implementing a reverse navigation home system that allows players to navigate back to their base from any location.
