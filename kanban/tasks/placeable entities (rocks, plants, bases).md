# Placeable entities.

I could circumvent some issues with placing objects during initialization if I could place the objects with a gui. This will require a pallette interface to select entities from and edit the characteristics of placed entities.

## Requirements

- A pallete for placing entities and units from groups
- A pallete for creating custom entities from existing components
- A drop down menu featuring the games active component systems
- A drop down menu featuring the games active entity groups
- Mouse event handlers for choosing where to place the entity

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement unit and entity group view elements to automaticly add each type of placable object automaticly instead of having to add them every time
- [ ] Implement tile pallette
- [ ] Implement mouse hover highlighting on canvas view
- [ ] Implement click event for placing selected entity.
