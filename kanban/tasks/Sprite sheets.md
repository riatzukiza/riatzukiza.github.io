# Description

The current implementation of [sprites](sprites.md) does not support sprite sheets, only individual [sprites](sprites.md). To animate them would require switching between different textures which may hurt performance
## Related Epics
- [Graphics](Graphics.md)
## Requirements

- There is an implementation of [sprites](sprites.md) with a new shader that allows for a single image sprite sheet
- The performance of the implementation is better than implementing animations alternating between textures
- There is a benchmark that demsonstrates this

## Tasks 

- [ ] Write new shader
- [ ] write new component system
- [ ] write component system for multi texture sprite animations
- [ ] write benchmark for comparing all 3 implementations (generating images from vert pixels one at a time, the current way, and the new way)
