# Description

I wrote a simple side scroller with a different implementation of [sprites](sprites.md). Make it work here, with that implementation of [sprites](sprites.md), and create new issues to upgrade it later.

- it shows up on [project](../project.md) page

## Tasks

- [ ] update imports
- [ ] [adjust](../../docs/Pools/Dynamic/adjust.md) code if needed to work with updated framework
