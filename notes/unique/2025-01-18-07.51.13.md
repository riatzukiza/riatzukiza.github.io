I want do design a chunk loader for a tile map wave function collapse that utilizes threads while also ensuring that the content the player can see and interact with always gets loaded. I was thinking I could make the game load unloaded chunks in the main thread when the agent can see them. I was also thinking about the implementation of a priority queue in the threaded chunk generator, but I was not sure about it. The chunks take around 8-13 seconds to generate, and they are generating 49 chunks at a time.
