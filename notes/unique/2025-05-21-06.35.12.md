## New

**Purpose:** Feature ideas we may or may not do. A place for brainstorming.

**Acceptance Criteria (to move to Accepted or Rejected):**
- We've started writing about it
- It seems feasible
- It is not a duplicate

---

## Rejected

**Purpose:** Tasks later deemed not useful or duplicates.

**Transitions:**  
`New` â†’ `Rejected`  
`Breakdown` â†’ `Rejected`

---

## Accepted

**Purpose:** Features we are considering.  
**Can only be rejected after** going through `Breakdown`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Brief description exists
- It has value
- Not a duplicate

**Transition:**  
`Accepted` â†’ `Breakdown`

---

## Breakdown

**Purpose:** Active design and refinement of accepted features.

**Definition of Done:**
- Requirements are clear
- Value is explained
- General implementation approach is outlined

**Transitions:**
- `Breakdown` â†’ `Ready`
- `Breakdown` â†’ `Blocked`
- `Breakdown` â†’ `Rejected`
- `Breakdown` â†’ `Ice Box` (if temporarily shelved)

---

## Blocked

**Purpose:** Feature is defined but requires a dependency or clarification before proceeding.

**Transition:**  
`Blocked` â†’ `Ready` (once unblocked)

---

## Ready

**Purpose:** Fully defined tasks waiting for prioritization.  
No WIP limits, but monitored to avoid backlog creep.

**Transition:**  
`Ready` â†’ `Todo`

---

## Todo

**Purpose:** Prioritized and estimated tasks queued for action.

**Transition:**  
`Todo` â†’ `In Progress`

---

## In Progress

**Purpose:** Actively being worked on.

**Transition:**  
`In Progress` â†’ `In Review`

---

## In Review

**Purpose:** Work completed and awaiting review or verification.

**Transition:**  
`In Review` â†’ `Done`

---

## Done

**Purpose:** Work reviewed and confirmed as complete.  
Time to celebrate. ðŸŽ‰

---

## Ice Box

**Purpose:** Temporarily shelved tasks that may be worth revisiting. These are *not rejected*, just deferred indefinitely.

**Use case:**
- Lost momentum
- No longer urgent
- Needs external input or energy you donâ€™t currently have

**Transition examples:**
- `Breakdown` â†’ `Ice Box`
- `Blocked` â†’ `Ice Box`
- `Accepted` â†’ `Ice Box`

**To unfreeze:**  
Review Ice Box periodicallyâ€”manually or when youâ€™re low on tasks.
