# Triage Checklist for Idea Evaluation

When reviewing an idea in the Triage column, ask yourself:

1. **Is this idea clearly described?**  
   - Can I summarize the goal or value in one sentence?  
   - If not, can I gather more info or should I reject for now?

2. **Is it unique?**  
   - Is this a duplicate or very similar to an existing idea/project?  
   - If yes, link or merge, then reject the duplicate.

3. **Does it align with my current goals or priorities?**  
   - Will this move me closer to my bigger objectives?  
   - If no, consider postponing or rejecting.

4. **Is it feasible?**  
   - Do I have the skills, resources, or time to pursue this?  
   - If not, is there a way to break it down into smaller doable parts?

5. **What’s the expected value or impact?**  
   - Will it improve my workflow, product, or personal growth meaningfully?  
   - If the impact seems marginal, deprioritize or reject.

6. **What’s the complexity and effort estimate?**  
   - Can I reasonably estimate the effort?  
   - If it’s too vague or too large, break it down further.

# Actions after evaluation:

- **Accept:** Move to Breakdown or Ready columns.  
- **Reject:** Move to Rejected or Archive with a short explanation.  
- **Break down:** Create smaller tasks if too big or unclear.  
- **Postpone:** Leave in Triage but lower priority, or move to a backlog if you want to delay.

# Optional notes:

- Jot down any blockers or questions for later clarification.  
- Link to related projects or ideas for context.
