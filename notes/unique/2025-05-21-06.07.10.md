# Brain Dump and Triage Process

## Purpose

This process distinguishes between **brain dumping** — capturing all ideas raw and unfiltered — and **triage**, where ideas are reviewed, filtered, and moved into the project workflow. 

The key insight:  
**Brain dumping requires no limits or controls to preserve creative flow.**  
**Triage requires strict limits to maintain focus and decision discipline.**

## Columns and Roles

### Brain Dump (aka Inbox)
- This column is a **freeform repository** for all ideas, no matter how vague, incomplete, or wild.
- **No Work In Progress (WIP) limits** apply here.
- Items stay here until actively pulled into triage.
- This column can grow large without causing stress or blocking the workflow.

### Triage (Idea Review)
- This column is the **decision zone** where ideas are examined critically.
- Apply **WIP limits** here (recommend 5–10 items max).
- Only cards in this column are actively reviewed for acceptance, rejection, or breakdown.
- Once reviewed, cards move forward to the project workflow or are rejected.

## Workflow

1. **Brain Dump freely and without hesitation.**  
   Capture every idea that comes to mind without self-censorship.

2. **Pull ideas into Triage in manageable batches.**  
   When the Triage column has capacity, move a limited number of cards from Brain Dump for review.

3. **Apply triage rigorously:**  
   - Accept ideas worth pursuing.  
   - Reject duplicates, irrelevant, or unfeasible ideas.  
   - Break down complex ideas into actionable tasks.

4. **Repeat as needed.**  
   Return to step 2 until the Brain Dump is cleared or all ideas are processed.

## Triggering Triage

- **Do not schedule triage as fixed, recurring “meetings.”**  
- Instead, triage is **triggered by capacity in the Triage column** (when under WIP limit).
- This respects the Kanban principle of pulling work based on workflow capacity, not arbitrary time.

## Benefits

- Preserves the **creative freedom** of brain dumping.  
- Enforces **focus and discipline** during triage.  
- Prevents **overwhelm and bottlenecks** in idea processing.  
- Keeps your kanban flow **lean and manageable**.

---

## Notes

- It’s okay for the Brain Dump column to grow very large temporarily.  
- Periodic clean-up or archival of old unprocessed ideas can be scheduled if needed, but only after triage catches up.

## Summary

**Brain Dump: No limits, all ideas welcome.**  
**Triage: Limited WIP, critical evaluation, and decision-making.**

This separation aligns Kanban with natural cognitive workflows and improves overall productivity.
