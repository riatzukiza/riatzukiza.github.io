I've been playing rim world a bit, seeing as it has features I was inspired by. Part of my task is to go through all these games I liked and decide why I like them. I like the work/priority system in rim world, but I don't like how they can't figure out to change it on their own. The rim worlders are total idiots. In my game I want to set some global priorities, but I also want agents to set their own. Maybe I do set like high level priorities, but the agents need to make lower level decisions as to how to best reach these priorities. Micro managing everything that they do is really hard and tedious when I'd like to be building stuff etc. They do some things, like eating, sleeping, and so on automaticly. Why do I have to tell them, "Yo cook that food, you've got enough for a meal". Shouldn't they be able to figure that out? Like on their priorities there's gotta be an inner thing going, "I don't want to eat this raw food" but the thought doesn't even occur to them to do that. Of course the game I want to make is a bit larger scale than rim world. You can't have a lot of people in rim world, when the game world I want to make is huge. Though first versions of it may end up being constrained to rimworld scales due to computational complexities. I believe these to be managable because When I make these maps right now I have to consider how large of a world I'm actually making for them. I should prioritize the camera and building systems. So I get some perspective.
