## Optimizations 
- swap back arrays
	- Delete entities from an array by swaping the place of the target to delete with the last entity, then shrink the array.
- Avoid last minute decision making
	- Avoid if statements in favor of membership in an array of entities in the same state and a specific function for processing those entities.
