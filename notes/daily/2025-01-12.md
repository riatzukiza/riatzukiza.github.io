As of yesterday I have a mostly working implementation of A*. When using noise to assign random nav coordinates, I noticed that if the noise assigned the end point to be directly adjacent to the start it would get caught in an infinite loop. It is specifically stuck on the cost function iirc from stepping through the code with the debugger last night.


I had a hard time yesterday when I decided I would add a vector to the Position system.
The numbers seemed to automaticly jump up every tick for no reason. I did this before starting work on path finding, to find when I ran everything *everything* was broken. 

I thought my path finding had issues, but it was me who had issues, thinking I could make any change, no matter how small, with out first testing it. I paid the price.
