I've been playing oxygen not included for some inspiration and winding down. I was working long hours and not taking weekends. I am about ready to start into the flow of working again. In the few moments working on crash landed has come to my mind while relaxing, I was thinking about fixing up the devops pipeline. It is slowing me down. Like a lot. That hack I wrote for running my code in a thread was also making loading take longer. The game needs persistance as well. There's no point in loading up the game when the world is different every time. To work on mechanics other than world gen, I need a world to work with that is stable. Playing basicly every other game out there I also need keyboard base wasd map navigation keys. There are some calls to Math.random that also have to be factored out. A world with a given seed should spawn the same every time. I should really start taking weekends. I wouldn't end up lumping all of my relaxing time into such long spans. It makes me feel like I am stagnating when I am not. It is about the same amount of off time I'd be doing other wise, just all at once. With that in mind, it's sunday today. as much as I may have the energy to do it right now, I am not going to start actually working on this until tomarrow.


Do we want to start organizing the work into sprints? I don't know, my mind changes so often it never made sense to me to set up sprints. And the ceremonies and all that, not useful a regular old kanban makes the most sense.
