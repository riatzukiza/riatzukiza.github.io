I'm moving towards encapsulated wrapper types for data to seperate data from functions, there was more in the world I made than I thought.

I don't exactly know what went wrong yet, I have not used indexeddb before this and am not sure if I am just using that interface poorly, or if I just have that much stuff in my game world.

I know one problem, the chunks use string flags. That is going to slow them down, I should set up some enums for them.

Cache hits come from similarly located data being logically associated data.

I think saving every part of the games data structure to hard disk is unnessisary.

Most of that infrastructure isn't nessisary.

that echos something that concerns me though doesn't it?


I see where the problem is. 
But not how to fix it, not at that scale.

i'll make it work for myself.


I think trying to save the whole game all at once was a mistake.

I need to focus on the map, that was the part that I thought needed to be either faster or be saved.


I'll treat the entity as a reference that associated a concept over many objects.
I create an entity, it gets a reliably unique id
