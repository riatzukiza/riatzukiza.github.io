The tile types are confusing. I am keeping this data in two seperate data types for two seperate contexts, with some overlapping behaviors.
They are basicly the same thing, except I don't have entities in the worker right now.
I need a worker pool. I don't need to be constantly generating world, but I do need to be constantly doing a bunch of things.
Trying to save my system has made me rethink my system.
