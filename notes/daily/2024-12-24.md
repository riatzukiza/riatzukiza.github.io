There is only so much I can keep track of with a board. Some thoughts, some processes, don't happen on the board. We can keep our daily standup and so on here in daily notes.

We've also added unqiue notes. Could be how we do blogs? We'll see how these all work out. It's sort of mind numbing to be writing tasks all day long. It's hard to connect everything, well, connect some things. It's easier to connect tasks to other tasks, but it's difficult to connect design elements to each other. Doing brainstorming only on the board.
