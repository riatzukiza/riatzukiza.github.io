we're going to split components up into saveable and unsavable.

seperate game state from rendering

combine the entity with the data from components in game saves?
keep components seperate and bound to an entity.

currently the world generator works on a trie, it could be faster if it represented the world as chunks of fixed length....

it does, it just also has the trie to facilitate initially finding the node your interested in and the chunk its located in. It's lazy, but does ultimately produce arrays of tiles in fixed length chunks.


I'm wondering if my use of generators has had any impact on the performance of that thread?

I could likely get some performance out of just removing the strings. The faster I can get it to load while I am testing other stuff the better.

I've been stuck on the game saves for a while now
