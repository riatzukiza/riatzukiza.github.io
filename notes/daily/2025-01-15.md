I have a basic implementation of wave function collapse completed. It is limited in it's abilities right now by the size of the modules (it's fixed at 3x3), then number of possible states for each tile (there are 3). It's good enough for now, I really needed a world with random, but coherent, structure. I needed this so the AI was not learning to solve for noise, then all it would know is noise. I needed the types of terrain to be clumpy, so food and such was equally scattered around, but with voids where there was no food, and areas where food was plentiful. This would encourage the exploration I desired.
