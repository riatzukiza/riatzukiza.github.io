I've been playing a lot of rim world the last two or so weeks. With my game engine and basic game systems being stable, I wanted to go back to some of the games that have inspired me the most. Rim world makes heavy use of AI, you could call it an AI management game. Agents are running all around the map with various priorities that you set, and orders that you create. They will execute the actions nearest to them in their current priority category until all actions in that category are completed, then they will move on to the next priority category of actions.

The game kinda learns how well you are playing, your skill level, and over time adjusts the difficulty. It calls its self a story telling game. The AI is the story teller.

This has me thinking.

The AI are using something like A* to find the shortest path to what ever thing they're looking for. A* uses  a weighted graph. ACO creates a weighted graph.

I think using ACO, it should be possible for agents in a game like rimworld to be more efficient with their actions. They don't always do the most important thing first.
