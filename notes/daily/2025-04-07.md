I don't have to keep a list of all entities, I just need to keep track of the next id for creating them.

Unless I wanted to abstract entity objects to direct you to the data that is associated with them.

I still wouldn't need to track all of the entities, the component managers track the entities associated with them, and it is from them we'd need to refer to the data to abstract.

The entity is just an ID. Every where we need it, it's there.
