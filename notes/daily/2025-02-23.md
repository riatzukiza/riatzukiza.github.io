I started trying to implement saves because the world was taking too long to generate.

While I tried to do this, I only barely made any progress saving my game.
I dfid make the world generat e faster with a simple cache.

Now I am looking at how all my data is stored, how to decide what data gets stored, and which is durived from the saved data.
