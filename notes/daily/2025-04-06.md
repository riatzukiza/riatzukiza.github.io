I've been working on getting an entity component system for multiple threads.

I have component arrays in a good place.
Entity creation however, very similar to components but also not.
Entities need unique identities.

Using the double buffer strategy, any thread can read any data, but only one thread can write at any index.

Multi tasking can happen one of two ways:
Each task operations on every entity with a component and writes the components values
Each task is split up into task groups, each task is done in paralell and writes to chunk of the buffer.

and each can be used together.

Entities, while being needed by every system, would be complicated to allow each system to create them.

If multiple threads try to make a new entity at the same time, what are those entities new ids?

It could be done, there are ways to make these ids.

It would be easier if like every other type of data though, it had it's own system to manage the values.

Other systems could request for an entity to be created for them on the next game tick.
if we make entity management a task for the main thread, the request for new entities could be made in the response to the end of the tick.

The particles could be made to be less clumpy if I do multiple collision ticks per physics tick.
