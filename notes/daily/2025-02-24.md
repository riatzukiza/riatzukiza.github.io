I've decided to work my way from the bottom up on this one. i started trying to get a save system to save time with world gens, only to increase world generation to fast enough I don' tneed the save so bad to work with it.

Only thing is I definately need the save.
My brute force "Saveable" object took very very long. like hours kinda long, I don't keep track of time so well on days that are are slo as that.

It has forced me to start thinking about how the memory of my system is organized.
