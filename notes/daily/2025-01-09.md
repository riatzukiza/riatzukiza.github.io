I have a basic world generation algorithim in place using perlin noise and a random walker.

The next steps are:
- Goal based path finding
- agents needs
- agent actions
- item system
- construction system
- static objects

Our first need is hunger.
Our first item is a carrot
Our first actions will be:
- Explore with goal
- explore without goal
- eat food item
- sleep
- harvest tree
- pick up item
- place blue print
- haul item to blueprint
- work oon blue print
Our first goal is to find and eat the carrot
Our second need is sleep.
Our first constructable item is a bed.
Our second goal is to sleep in that bed.

With the two sets of needs implemented, we have somthing to prioritize.
When scoring possible actions it will wieght actions according to the current distrobution of needs. If the rest need is higher than the eating need, the agent will prioritize rest and vise versa.

If an agent's satiation reaches 0, their health will begin to deteriorate until they die.

All actions will cause the agents calorie level to drop faster.
The agent will always burn calories even when performing no actions.
Healing will cause calories to be burned
An agent resting will reduce the rate of calorie burns and increase healing rate and efficiency.
