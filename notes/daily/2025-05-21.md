If I could just focus long enough on one thing, there are so many things I could create.
But my mind is tossed around like the wind.
If I remembered to write more, to capture the thoughts before they left me.
There is here a repository of things I could do, I could make.

I'm getting there. Focusing for a bit longer each time I try, I am slowly leaving the burnout.
I should finish the projects I started. There isn't much more, it is mostly rewriting some import statements after moving the projects away from a require model.

I keep seeing these ads for ground news, I think to myself each time how easy it'd be to create a platform like that. One that ran on ones own computer. Classifying text is a pretty well solved task.

I could make my own classifier, I could use existing classifiers. It doesn't matter, those would both be rather easy tasks.

I want my strong laptop back, but the screen is broken.

This laptops gpu isn't that bad. It's rather amazing how far tech has come that even the embedded gpu on even a cheaper laptop is.

This isn't the cheapest possible laptop. I've gotten gpu fancy laptops for 600 this one as 700, though the main feature on this is the touch screen and cpu.

The cpu has the gpu dingus.
