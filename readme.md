# Project Description

Sentient sand, as I am now calling the [project](kanban/project.md) using ACO, is doing very well. It works exactly as intended, and now only needs refinements.

I use https://obsidian.md to manage markdown files for [documentation](kanban/tasks/documentation.md) and [project](kanban/project.md) management
